    * record lineage somehow
    * add ability to type in id of creature to select
    * change the food algorithm to grow (and die) food faster with a lower limit per tile so that food doesnt' accumulate as much, and
      there isn't as much difference between the high food environment vs the low food environment.  As it is now, different creatures
      thrive in the different environments, and a higher food environment makes them behave more like what i want to see
    * what if you made it so that creatures could either eat or move forward, but not both 
    * try lstm/gru/or something

    * make non-uniform terrain generator, to make splotches of growth and deadness
     
    * add stats display for how many spawns a creature has, and how much food per timeslices they've eaten
    * could you add a way to keep all the creatures that ever lived, and store the dead ones in a separate list
      so that you can calculate statistics on them?  Or do it as a running tally?

    * fix file writing so that it doesn't overwrite conflicting file names
    * should there be a way to dump all the creatures in ranked order?
