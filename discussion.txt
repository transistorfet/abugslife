What if you based the world on eating numbers, and each creature could use formulas to get the numbers it needs in order to survive.
They could all be trying to get the same number (like ATP), and they'd need to sometimes expend their numbers in order to do things
like move, or use a formula to 'metabolize' one number into the number you need.

So the ground tiles would have a bunch of numbers stored on each, and they would replenish themselves using different formula.  The
creatures could then 'eat' those numbers.  They would then use a formula to convert the number into the 'energy' number it needs.
It can then use those 'energy' numbers in equations to move and interact and stuff.  Then other creatures could possible 'eat' the
other creatures to get their energy numbers, but they'd have to have a cost or restriction of some kind.
